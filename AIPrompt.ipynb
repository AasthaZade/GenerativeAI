Dramatic lighting with long shadows and highlights catching the chrome details. Lush green hills and a turquoise ocean visible in the background. Sharp focus on the car, shallow depth of field. Asphalt road with realistic textures. Cinematic, vibrant colors. High quality, 16:9 aspect ratio, octane render.\n",
